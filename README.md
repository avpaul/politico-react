We are used to _*ballot box elections*_ and the whole process it takes until we get election results.
Polling places, ballot box, ballot paper, counting votes and so on can be expensive and tedious.
Technology especially internet powers many things nowadays from booking your next vacation ticket
to doing business across the five continents from home! It's time to take our elections online :computer: :+1:

> The ballot box election is the traditional form of voting
> which takes place directly at the polling place.
